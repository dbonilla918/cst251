			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>I wanted to challenge myself a bit for this lab and create a different layout for this site. I went with a layout of two seperate blocks that take up equal parts width of the screen, but can be extended downwards as far as they need to. I had a bit of trouble figuring it out at first but I'm satisfied with what I did. I went ahead and also did the Task X bonus and used some google fonts to style my html page. Getting it to work with my CSS page was pretty easy.</p>
