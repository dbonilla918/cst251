			<h2>My Web Design experience</h2>
				<p>I actually took a semester of HTML/CSS at cabrillo right before transfering here. I did really well and learned a lot of useful information and skills from that class that I hope to implement and improve in this one.</p>

			<h2>Personal Goals With This Class</h2>
				<p>My main goal with this class is to keep improving and building on the foundational skills I already know. I want to continue learning about HTMl and CSS because its something that really interests me and I feel is something that would benefit me as a designer. I hope I can help others along the way as well.</p>

			<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
				<p>This is my first semester here at CSUMB. I am a Communication Design major with a concentration in Game Design. I love to work on cars, I enjoy watching anime on my free time, spending time with my family and friends, playing video games, and recently I've been hiking quite often with my friends which is super fun.</p>
