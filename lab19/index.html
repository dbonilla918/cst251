      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      <h5>I will use this section to describe any challenges I encountered.</h5>
      <p>Working with this new layout was a bit confusing at first and getting to really understand how it worked took a little longer than thought. I didn't fully understand what the difference from this and flexbox was at first, but with a bit of research and digging I personally came to like this style of layout better.</p>

      <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
      <h5>Here I will discuss any problems I faced while completing this lab.</h5>
      <p>One of the big problems I was using at first was styling the page the way I wanted it to. I am so used to working with the conventional CSS elements so I thought that maybe I could carry over a few of these to this layout style, but I was wrong. It has its own unique way of styling elements, and its actually pretty cool.</p>

      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <h5>This section talks about the results of the lab.</h5>
      <p>For the final product of this page, I wanted to do something easy but still appealing. I went with a 444 layout for the main portion of the text and gave it a black/green theme since those are my two favorite colors. I used the sample code from w3schools and changed it up to fit my needs. I like how this turned out and it looks greate at different screen sizes too!</p>
