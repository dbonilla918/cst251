	<h1>Subject: More HTML</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to work with adding links and images to our html sites.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The only challenge I had was remembering how to open a link in a new tab when you click on it, but thanks you W3Schools, I was able to figure it out. </p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>The results of my work are presented in the form of this website you are currently on. I have a slight obsession with my car so I wanted to do a little tribute to it on here. The following pictures are some of my persnal favorites.</p>

		<figcaption>Detail shot of the rear of my car. I love how the colors work here, it's a satisfying balance of dark and earthy colors with a pop of red. If you click on the picture it will redirect you to a vision of what i hope my car will looks like one day, enjoy.</figcaption>
